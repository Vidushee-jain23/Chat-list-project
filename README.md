# Chat-list-project
This project is a simple implementation of a WhatsApp-like chat application using object-oriented programming concepts in C++. It allows users to perform various operations on their chat conversations. Here's a brief description of the features and functionality:

1. Add Chat: Users can add new chat conversations by providing the sender name, receiver name, and message content.

2. Display Chats: All existing chat conversations are displayed, showing the sender, receiver, message, timestamp, and read status of each chat.

3. Mark Chat as Read: Users can mark a specific chat as read by providing the chat index.

4. Search Chats by Sender/Receiver Name: Users can search for chats based on the sender or receiver name. The search results display the relevant chat conversations.

5. Delete Chat: Users can delete a specific chat by providing the chat index.

6. Exit: Allows the user to exit the application.

The program utilizes classes and objects to represent chats and the chat list.
